### Design prompt

Design a menu preview app for a modern restaurant.

### The problem

Working people want healthy meals but don’t have time for cooking and don’t want to order from fast food restaurants.

### An overview

Flavoroso is an app that aims to help working people or people who don’t have time to cook for themselves and want at the same time to know more detailed information about the meals. The app allows the user to view the meals and pre-order them before coming to the restaurant and that saves time of the users by knowing ahead if the restaurant has the required meals or not.

### The goal

Flavoroso app allows the users to view detailed information about the nutrition values and the ingredients used in making the meals.

### My role

### My responsibilities

Conducting interviews, paper, and digital wireframing, low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototyping, conducting usability studies, accounting for accessibility, and iterating on the design.

### Duration

2 weeks.
